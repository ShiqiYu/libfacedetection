---------------------
* Update the model to v2. The computational cost is doubled. But the speed is almost the same with the previous one because int8 convolutional operation is carried out by AVX2.
* NEON support is not finished.

2019-03-13
---------------------
* Release the source code and the model files. Removed the binary libary. 

2018-11-17
---------------------
* Replaced the AdaBoost methods with a CNN based one.

2017-02-24
---------------------
* landmark detection speed reaches to 0.8ms per face. The former version is 1.7ms per face.

2017-01-20
---------------------
* 68-point landmark detection added.

2016-11-24
---------------------
* Added benchmark.cpp which can run face detection in multiple threads using OpenMP.

2016-11-16
---------------------
* Bugs in the previous version were fixed. std::vector was removed from the API because it can cause error.

2016-11-10
---------------------
* The API was updated. std::vector was involved.
* The functions can be called in multiple threads at the same time.

2016-10-6
---------------------
* The algorithm has been speeded up greatly (2x to 3x). 
* The true positive rates (FDDB) have been improved 1% to 2% at FP=100.
* Multi-core parallelization has been disabled. The detection time is still the same.

2016-9-16
---------------------
* Speedup again.
* Change function name facedetect_frontal_tmp() to facedetect_frontal_surveillance(). This function now uses a new trained classifier which can achieve a higher detection speed.

2016-6-28
---------------------
* 64-bit dll added since there are so many users request it.
* An easter egg is hidden in the 64-bit dll. Can you find it?

2016-6-8
---------------------
* Speedup 1.2x
* Added an experimental function facedetect_frontal_tmp(). The function can gain a higher detection rate in video surveillance.
