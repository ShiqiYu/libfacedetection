# libfacedetection

This is an open source library for CNN-based face detection in images. The CNN model has been converted to stastic variales in C source files. The source code does not depend on any other libraries. What you need is just a C++ compiler. You can compile the source code under Windows, Linux, ARM and any platform with a C++ compiler.

SIMD instructions are used to speedup the detection. You can enable AVX2 if you use Intel CPU or NEON for ARM.

The model file has also been provided in directory ./models/.

examples/libfacedetectcnn-example.cpp shows how to use the library.

## How to Compile

* Please add -O3 to turn on optimizations when you compile the source code using g++.
* Please choose 'Maximize Speed/-O2' when you compile the source code using Microsoft Visual Studio.

mkdir -p build; cd build; rm -rf *;

### Cross build for aarch64
1. set cross compiler for aarch64
2. set opencv path since the example code depends on opencv
OPENCV_SRC="/opencv/source/path"

```
cmake \
    -DENABLE_INT8=ON \
    -DENABLE_NEON=ON \
    -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=RELEASE \
    -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=/${OPENCV_SRC}/platforms/linux/aarch64-gnu.toolchain.cmake \
     ..

make
```

### Native build for avx2
```
cmake \
    -DENABLE_INT8=ON \
    -DENABLE_AVX2=ON \
    -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=RELEASE \
     ..

make
```
